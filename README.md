# Flask Project

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
Clone the repository to your local machine using SSH (generate an SSH key if needed, add the public key to your GitHub account).
Create a new branch named after your username (e.g., Tutedude).
Add your Flask project files to this branch.
Commit the changes and merge the branch into the main branch.

Run commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py
